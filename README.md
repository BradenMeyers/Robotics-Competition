# Welcome to the Team

This where we can put our files so everyone has access to them. As we work on the project, it is easy to push our changes to this repository so we always have the latest versino saved. All you need to do is make a github account and send me you username. I can make you a collaborator. Just send me a text or email me at zadriskill@gmail.com.
